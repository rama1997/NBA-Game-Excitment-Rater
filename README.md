## Win Prediction Model
Implemented a win prediction model in order to have a more accurate representation of whether or not a game was close or consisted of a comeback.

Model Details:
- Instead of building one model for the entire game, 5 seperate model were built in order to represent the first, second, third, and fourth quarter as well as overtime
- Each model was a locally weighted Logistic Regression Model using the LOESS method
- Models were trained on historical play by play data and results for all regular season and playoff NBA games over the last 15 years(2007-2022) obtained from the NBA API 
- Win probability is calculate as a function of game time and the score difference
- Model assumes a 50/50 model meaning both team are evenly matches and playing on a neutral court which removes home court advantage. Does not take into account historical team nor player performance.

Steps used to build my models can be found in the `model` folder

## Usage
Configure `config.py` with the desired data

- Requires credential for Youtube API
- Include favorite teams/players to search for
- Set minimum point count to be considered as a high scorer

Example included in `config.py`

## Todo:
- Improve how a close game is determined. How close the game stayed at the 50/50 probability
